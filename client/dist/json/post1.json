  "post_title": "Debugging lambdas using the serverless framework + serverless-webpack.",
  "post_slug": "debugging-lambdas-serverless-webpack",
  "post_content": "<p>Our team has started to use the <a href=\"https://serverless.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">serverless-framework</a> to create microservices. We have built API's for basic CRUD features to full fledged ETL processes which pipe our microservice data back to our reporting database. This framework saves us a lot of time and gives us guidelines to organize our lambda's and AWS resources into categorized services. We use the <a href=\"https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">serverless-offline plugin</a> to run our lambdas in a local environment and we use it alongside our test suite. One thing that we were missing with this framework was the ability to use <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visual studio debugging</a> support with nodejs. It's a beautiful thing to be able to see what's going on in your app at runtime. As a team, we missed dropping in `debugger`.</p><p>We use the <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">serverless-webpack plugin</a> to bundle our project before we deploy to AWS. This intially appeared to add a layer of complexity to debugging. After reading through this <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack/issues/42#issuecomment-288845943\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">thread</a> however, we saw the light.</p><p>All we needed to do was update our <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/lucasklaassen/7c18b28d8c4d692db439ca367e973db0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">webpack.config.js</a> with `devtool: 'source-map'`. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/lucasklaassen/6b09ae7ee5542f2a69c494a66362fc4b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here is a copy of our launch.json file</a> which you can use within Visual Studio Code to get debugging support setup.</p><p>If you have any comments or questions please reach out on the gist's provided or <a href=\"mailto:lucasklaassen1@gmail.com\">send me an email.</a></p>",
